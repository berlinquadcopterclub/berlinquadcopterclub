Berlin Quadcopter Club
====================

The purpose of this repository is to organize meetings, figure out the best quadcopters, and store data related to quadcopter-related things in Berlin.

First 'Copter
--------------------
Some things to keep in mind getting a first quadcopter:
 - Look for "RTF" (Ready to Fly). Comes with transmitter, battery, etc. to fly out of the box
 - Get something cheap, probably will crash it (maybe get guards as well to not break the blades)
 - Personally, I want a camera as well to get something out of it.
 - Don't go for the micro quadcopters. Even though they're 30€, they are too small and hard to control. Some weight is good to avoid getting knocked around by wind.
 - Get extra batteries, they only last 5-7 min. Multichargers make it easier to recharge multiple batteries at the same time. USB recharging.

A popular "first" quadcopter is the Syma X5C. It's around 70€, comes with a camera, SD card, remote control, battery, propeller guards, and charger. It handles well indoors and outdoors, and is good quality for the price.

Locations
--------------------
 - Tempelhof airport field is a popular place to go fly, and has lots of open room to practice.
 - Tiergarten has some open spaces, but also a lot of trees and you need to be careful not to get your quadcopter stuck in a tree. Also, be mindful to others in the park.
