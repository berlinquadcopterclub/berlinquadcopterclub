Berlin Quadcopter Club
====================

The purpose of this repository is to organize meetings, figure out the best quadcopters, and store data related to quadcopter-related things in Berlin.

First 'Copter
--------------------
Some things to keep in mind getting a first quadcopter:
 - Look for "RTF" (Ready to Fly). Comes with transmitter, battery, etc. to fly out of the box
 - Get something cheap, probably will crash it (maybe get guards as well to not break the blades)
 - Personally, I want a camera as well to get something out of it, but a mini-quadcopter (some cost 20-30â‚¬) would be good to learn with.
 - Get extra batteries, they only last 5-7 min. Multichargers make it easier to recharge multiple batteries at the same time. USB recharging.
